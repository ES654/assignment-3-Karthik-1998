Among degree 1,3,5,7,9

The data set has more of the fashion 9th degree polynomial because the max of absolute of coefficients are high in 9th degree compared to other degrees as above.

For varying N the magnitude of coeffiecients changed but the model has large coefficients in higher degree which is 9 here.
