Gradient Descent is working for multi-collinearity data.

In this created multi-collinear data by creating a feature which depends in linear fashion with the other two feature vectors in the data set and added that feature to the data set as an extra column.

By applying gradient descent on it the metrics are as follows:


with_intercept:
RMSE:  0.9355082402118939
MAE:  0.7608408783748771

without intercept:
RMSE:  0.953065114383952
MAE:  0.7644086195569068
